# Mail MailServer.MailServer

## What does MailServer.MailServer do
#### Short answer:
Nothing really :(
#### Long answer:
This project has been developed for academic reasons and thus it might not seem all that fancy.
However, it is a good starting point for anyone who wants to get started with application layer protocols.
Some cli-based, simple, general-mail features are provided:
- MailServer.Account management
- MailServer.Email creation/ deletion/ transmission
- MailServer.Email preview

## About
This is a very simplistic approach of MailServer.Email server-client protocol, written in Java.
